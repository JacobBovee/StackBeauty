# Contribution to StackBeauty

You can contribute to StackBeauty with issues and PRs. Simply filing issues for problems you encounter is a great way to contribute. Contributing implementations is greatly appreciated.

Issues include new ideas, frontend/backend bugs, feature requests are welcome.

PRs for code on either frontend or backends as well as documentations are appreciated.

## Contributing Changes

Project maintainers will merge changes that improve the product significantly and broadly align with the design. We may revert changes if they are found to be breaking.

## DOs and DON'Ts

Please do:

* **DO** follow our coding style (C# code-specific) //TODO: Provide the link
* **DO** include tests when adding new features. When fixing bugs, start with adding a test that highlights how the current behavior is broken.
* **DO** keep the discussions focused. When a new or related topic comes up it's often better to create new issue than to side track the discussion.
* **DO** your best to factor commits appropriately, not too large with unrelated things in the same commit, and not too small with the same small change applied N times in N different commits.

Please do not:

* **DON'T** surprise us with big pull requests. Instead, file an issue and start a discussion so we can agree on a direction before you invest a large amount of time.
* **DON'T** commit code that you didn't write. If you find code that you think is a good fit to add, file an issue and start a discussion before proceeding.
* **DON'T** submit PRs that alter licensing related files or headers. If you believe there's a problem with them, file an issue and we'll be happy to discuss it.
* **DON'T** add API additions without filing an issue and discussing with us first.

## Recommended workflow

1. Create an issue for your work or pick an existing one.
2. Create a personal fork of the repository on GitHub (if you don't already have one).
3. In your fork, create a branch off of main (git checkout -b mybranch).
4. Make and commit your changes to your branch.
5. Build and test the API / Frontend in your workspace.
6. Create a pull request (PR) against the StackBeauty repository's main branch.
  * State in the description what issue or improvement your change is addressing.
  * Check if all the Continuous Integration checks are passing.
8. Wait for feedback or approval of your changes
9. When the PR is signed off, and all checks are green, your PR will be merged.
